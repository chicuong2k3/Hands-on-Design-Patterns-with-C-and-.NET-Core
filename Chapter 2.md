# Design principles

## DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself
Some common causes of code duplication:
- Lack of understanding:
  - Don't have a full understanding of an existing solution
  - Don't know how to apply abstraction to solve the problem with existing functionality
- Copy and paste

## KISS – Keep It Simple Stupid
## YAGNI – You Aren't Gonna Need It

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them

## MVP – Minimum Viable Product

The scope of a piece of work is limited to the smallest set of requirements in order to produce a functioning deliverable

## SOLID

# Software patterns

## GoF patterns

## Enterprise integration patterns

### Topology

- hub-and-spoke
- enterprise service bus

## Patterns

- Messaging: patterns related to messaging can take the form of message construction and channels
- Transformation: allow for flexibility in how messages are handled in the system. With transformation, a message between two applications can be altered or enhanced
- Routing: provide different approaches to handling messages

# Software development life cycle

## Waterfall SDLC

- Requirements phase
- Design phase
- Development phase
- Testing phase
- Deployment phase

## Agile SDLC
